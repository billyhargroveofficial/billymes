/**
 * The inline connector cards.
 *
 * A task needing Jira *and* Figma offers both at once instead of blocking
 * twice — one card per connector, because a connector IS the unit of state
 * here: its own endpoint, its own sign-in, its own failure.
 *
 * Everything about *how* a connector connects — write config, flip enabled,
 * probe, sign in — belongs to `lib/mcp-connectors`. These components own the
 * consent surface and the phase presentation, nothing else. That's what lets
 * a no-auth server connect with one click and an OAuth one open a browser
 * tab from the same button, with no branching here.
 *
 * Each card also owns its own *recovery*. Three connectors is three OAuth
 * flows against three servers — under the MCP auth spec a token is bound to
 * one resource, so partial failure is a property of the protocol and the UI
 * only gets to choose whether it represents it honestly. So a card that
 * fails keeps its Retry while its siblings settle around it, and the tool
 * answers once every card has either connected or been waved off.
 *
 * Consent vocabulary follows the approval bar: primary-tinted action with
 * `⌘⏎`, ghost decline with `Esc`, clarify's focus stand-down so keystrokes
 * meant for the composer are never eaten.

 *

 * "verified · notion.com" — checkable identity, not an endorsement, which is
 * why it names the domain instead of claiming trust. Everything else gets
