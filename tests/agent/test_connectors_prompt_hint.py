"""What the agent is told about connectors it could set up.

The hint has two sources. ``mcp.connectors`` records apps the user said they
use during desktop onboarding; the reviewed catalog covers everyone else,
including the user who skipped the picker entirely. Nothing in either list is
configured and no credential was collected — that is the point, since sign-in
is deferred to the moment a task needs the app.

The gap only pays off if the agent knows about it. Asked to "check my linear
backlog" with no hint, a model does what any model without that knowledge
does: greps the environment for `LINEAR_API_KEY` and asks the user to paste
one. So these tests pin the properties that make the hint useful without
being harmful:

- it names connectors the user said they use
- it names catalog connectors even when the user never picked any
- it drops one the moment it IS configured, so the agent never offers a
  connector the user already has
- it still names a configured connector whose sign-in never finished, the one
  state that is otherwise invisible: too configured to offer, too parked to
  register any tools
- it forbids the detours (asking for a key, asking which auth method,
  hand-rolling the vendor API) that the card exists to replace
- it only reaches the desktop, the one surface with ``setup_mcp``

Run against the real prompt builder: the hint lives in the byte-stable cached
prefix, and a mock would hide the cache-safety property being verified.
